The provided data csv consists of 3 columns/information fields: year, month & monthly mean total sunspot number. This is then visualized in a chart.
The monthly mean total sunspot no. is scaled to range between 0 and 1, to normalize data and help with training stability and performance.
Input samples are then created via the sliding-window method. A window of size 12 (according to sunspot cycles' yearly pattern, each element for a month's mean total sunspot no.); the steps_ahead is set at 1.
-> 12 months of mean total sunspot no. are features and the next one's the label.
The window slides forward, taking the next 12, and the one after that becomes the label. This is repeated for the entire csv.

The 3288 input data is then separated into training and testing sets (which takes 10% / or 329 rows).

A RNN model is created, includes three RNN layers, 50 hidden units each.
Add a dense layer perceptron at the end for a single number output (the mean total sunspot no of next month).
Use tanh activation function vecause input and output values are in the range from 0 to 1.
The model is compiled with mean_squared_error loss function and the adam optimizer, common choices for regression tasks.

After training, the model is used to make predictions on both training and testing sets.
The RMSE is calculated for both, then compared. 
Their values are pretty close. In other words, the model is not overfitted and generalizing well.
Visualization between predictions and actual values show that while there are minor differences, but the overall cyclical trend is captured.
